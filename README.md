This project was made for the final assessment of the course Agent Technology Practical.

The project consists of simulating evacuation strategies in the ground floor of the Bernoulliborg building (University of Groningen) using an agent-based model environment in NetLogo.
In steps, the project consisted of:
- Manually creating the simulation environment in NetLogo based on existing evacuation maps of the Bernoulliborg building
- Implementing 3 evacuation strategies; namely _random_, _directed_, and _staged_ evacuation strategies, by manipulating the agent behavior depending on the strategy chosen
- Comparing the strategies on time efficiency and safety outcomes

More information on the project can be found in the report.
